        <h2>Grammar Task: What is Passive Voice?</h2>
        <p>In the passive voice, the focus is on the action or the recipient of the action rather than on who is performing the action. This structure is often used when the doer is unknown, unimportant, or obvious.</p>
        <h3>Structure:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Present Simple: am/is/are + past participle (e.g., The book is read by many people.)</li>
            <li>Past Simple: was/were + past participle (e.g., The project was completed on time.)</li>
            <li>Future Simple: will be + past participle (e.g., The report will be finished by Friday.)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>When to Use Passive Voice:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>When the doer of the action is unknown: "The car was stolen."</li>
            <li>When the doer is not important: "A decision was made."</li>
            <li>To emphasize the action or the recipient: "The painting was admired by everyone."</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Exercise: Convert the following sentences from active to passive voice:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The chef prepares the meal.</li>
            <li>The company will launch a new product.</li>
            <li>They are painting the house.</li>
            <li>The teacher explained the lesson.</li>
            <li>Scientists discovered a new planet.</li>

        <h2>Text: Is a Degree Worth It?</h2>
        <p>
                                                              Is a Degree Worth It?

    In today's competitive job market, the question of whether a college degree is worth the investment has become increasingly relevant. On one hand, a degree can open doors to higher-paying jobs and opportunities in specialized fields. Many employers require a degree as a minimum qualification, particularly in sectors like healthcare, engineering, and technology.
    However, the rising costs of tuition and student debt have led many to reconsider the necessity of a degree. Some successful individuals have built their careers without formal education, relying instead on hands-on experience and skill development. Additionally, trade schools and vocational training offer alternative pathways to rewarding careers that do not require a four-year degree.
    Ultimately, the value of a degree may depend on individual career goals, the industry one wishes to enter, and the financial implications of obtaining that degree.</p>
